# chessAI-cpp

A chess bot written in c++ using minimax breadth-first-search and alpha-beta pruning.

Use `g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o out` to compile.  

For usage, just do `./out` and then make your terminal big enough to see the entire board (in total 21 lines).  

The `chess.hpp` file is from [this c++ chess library](https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library) and is not my work.
